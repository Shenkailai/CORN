#### Prepare your data
- Create a data directory on disk and change the data location in **mian.py**.
- **Note**: you should have **a clean audio folder**, **a distorted audio folder**, and **a csv file** with file name information and quality scores (please modify the recognizable columns in your csv file in **main.py**).
- **Note**: The model parameters given are nisqa-corpus training results, which you can choose to call directly.

#### Operation
- **python main.py** 

- **Dataset**: Due to the need of the experiment, we used [NISQA-Corpus](https://github.com/gabrielmittag/NISQA?tab=readme-ov-file) for training, evaluation and testing.
- **Code & Model**: Due to the needs of the experiment, we used NISQA-Corpus for training, evaluation and testing. The framework of corn has been modified from the original text, it is not completely consistent.
